        about: `My recipe development and food photography career began a number of years ago when our local newspaper, The Commercial Appeal asked me to write a column for the food section entitled “Dinner For Two,” which enjoyed a seven-year run.

        I started From A Chef’s Kitchen in 2014 to share my passion for cooking and food.  Here, I share easy, creative gourmet recipes from my kitchen.  My recipes are inspired by ingredients I already have on hand or what’s in season at the market.  I include plenty of tips and information to help you succeed in making each dish.`,
